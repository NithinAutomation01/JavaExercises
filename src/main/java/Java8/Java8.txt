Java 8  can have the interface methods defined 
 Usage of functional programming
 StreamAPI helps in concurrency and functional programming
 
until Java 7 we can only declare methods in the interface but cant define them
Stream API is added with List interface in Java8

Nessesity to implement defining a method inside the interface is as follows
		
		Lets say the List interface has x methods when the stream api method is added with the interface without
		defining them then all the classes that has already implemented the List interface will need this Stream API
		method defined which cant be done as the software product is already rendered with lower versions of Java(1-7)
		
		
		
Declaring a Default will help us define a method inside the interface


The Folder InterfaceDefinitionandImplementation contains an exercise to check the interface definition and
the usage of static methods in java8


In the Internal Interations we use the consumer Interface which is a functional interface(Can have only one method)
ie the consumer interface has only one method called accept
